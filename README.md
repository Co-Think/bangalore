# Bangalore Issues and Project Ideation
- We use issue tracker to efficiently collaborate on the planning the issuses and designing solutions in software development all the time.
- I believe something similar can help normal citizens as well where they come and raise their issues and collaboratively provide each other knowledge and come up with a solution.

## FAQs
### Why not discuss in social media apps like twitter, reddit and whatsapp?
Because that does not keep the issue well structured at a central place which hinders its effective discovery and evolution.

### What is this platform supposed to be?
Mostly a collaborative issue tracker targetting local-first mindset of solving issues for your local community before anything else. The extent of this is raising issues and enriching them with the right information till it can start causing real-world improvement. The north star goal for this is something like this -
- An app where you all users are registered with their national ID, this will encourage authenticity and discourage spamming.
- Anyone raises an issue, and other members add the related information such as concerned organisations, authorities, processes, contact process, legal steps etc.
- The issue evolves and becomes a well structured wiki and guide.
- Members can also add local project ideas and brainstorm on it.
- Eventually a lot of things such as basic information enhancemenmt on the topics can be automated with AI.

A customer experience will look like that -
- I live in Bellandur, Bangalore. I open the app, I see the top 5 issues reported by community members.
- I can check their details, vote for them, add details to them based on my knowledge.
- Concerned people can take the enriched issue and perform the real-world actions.

For now, the fastest way to check this is to use a simple, free and version-controlled issue-tracker where large number of people can collaborate.
- Github is one such option. If the traction is good and this actually turns out to be helpful for people, we will plan a proper app.
- While some evolved / archived issues will be converted from issues to proper guides and stored in the repository, that is not the primary purpose,  

### What it is not?
- General social media - The primary data of this system is Issues / Projects. All discussions should be done around that only.
